# Outbreak Investigations: 
Considering the Oswego gastro-related illness onset of illnesses after a shared supper, consider the following questions: 
- Is this an epidemic? Is this an outbreak?
	- Due to closed nature of the spread of the illness and the fact that its gastro-related suggests that its moreso an outbreak and not an epidemic. Only individuals that attended the shared supper faced symptoms and even then not all patients suffered equally or even at all. 
- What is a vehicle? What is a vector?
	- A vehicle is something that the patient MUST go out of their way to interact with to contract the illness. A vector is an active part of the lifecycle of the disease and is necessary to the transmission of the disease. 
- What is a reservoir?
	- A reservoir is capable of containing the disease, like the Earth naturally containing tetanus. 
- What information would you collect? 
	- Demographic information 
		- Age
		- Sex
		- Ethnicity/Race
		- Socioeconomic standing and access to healthcare
	- Acute history of the patient:
		- Where they've been recently, even before the onset?
		- What is their diet naturally?
	- Clinical history of the patient:
		- Do they take any medications? Any other underlying or pre-existing medical/health conditions that affect the patient?
		- Contact tracing between infected individuals and finding patient-zero
	- Epidemiologic Studies:
		- Tracking what foods were available and who consumed what 
		- Time of onset of symptoms 
- What is the value of an epidemic curve?

# Midterm Review: 
# Basics: 
- We assume that **death and disability do NOT occur at random** 
- The **causes** of *death and disability can be identified through a systemic investigation of human populations*
	- Identifying such causes allows for the development of preventive interventions
	- Investigations allow us to identify trends across the public's health
		- This allows us to **understand/identify growing threats** and to **provide advanced warnings**, therefore helping **ensure that people stay healthy**
		- Ultimately, the aim is to **maximize societal benefit and to minimize the burden of death and disability** 
		- We can **reduce health disparities across different demographics** to *increase satisfaction/QOL and longevity of life* 
## Populations: 
To understand what a "human population" is, we look at an individual in regards to three major categories, including:
- ### Persons:
	- The information at the individual level, including demographics like:
		1) Age
		2) Sex/Gender
		3) Marital Status
		4) Race/ethnicity 
		5) Nativity and migration 
		6) Religion
		7) Socioeconomic status
		8) ...
- ### Place: 
	- The information regarding spatial and cultural influence, such as: 
		1) Climate
		2) Cultural Factors 
		3) Dietary Habits
		4) Health Care Access
		5) ...
	- We must recognize that disease, health behaviors, and mortality show great variation globally and even at the state, region, and county levels. 
		- This includes urban vs rural differences, which are often caused by: 
			1) Crowding
			2) Pollution
			3) Poverty
			4) Violence
			5) Food Access
			6) Health Care Access
			7) ...
- ### Time: 
	- There are periodic changes in the frequency of diseases and health conditions over time, often at the scale of months and even years, and are often caused by: 
		1) Changes in lifestyle due to age 
		2) Seasonal changes
		3) Virality of infectious agents 
		4) Cultural shifts
## Exposures & Outcomes: 
- An **exposure** is the hypothesized cause of an *outcome*. 
- An **outcome** is the health event of interest. 
### Epidemiology Triad: 
- To define the epidemiological triad, we consider three distinct factors that determine the spread/onset of a disease: 
	- #### Host Factors: 
		- Personal traits
		- Behaviors 
		- Genetics
		- ...
	- #### Agent Factors: 
		- Biological (pathogenic)
		- Physical 
		- Chemical
	- #### Environment: 
		- External conditions
		- Physical, biologic, or social factors 
- We can consider the *patterns of disease to be stable when homeostasis exists* in the triad. 
	- A *changing disease pattern* $\implies$the triad is unbalanced
- The triad is often visualized such that: $$\begin{matrix}
& \text{Host} & \\
\nearrow\swarrow& & \nwarrow\searrow \\
\text{Agent}& \longleftrightarrow& \text{Environment}
\end{matrix}$$
## Spectrum of Disease: 
- The lifecycle of a disease, aka spectra, can be divided into four main categories, including: 
	- #### Susceptibility: 
		- When the host is exposed to a disease/event 
	- #### Subclinical: 
		- Includes the incubational period, meaning the host is being affected by the agent, but does not yet show symptoms 
	- #### Clinical: 
		- Occurs after the incubation period and includes the onset of symptoms of disease
	- #### Recovery: 
		- Occurs after the host no longer shows symptoms of disease
## Disease Transmission: 
- The mode of transmission describes how infectious diseases are transmitted, including two main categories, such that: 
	- ### Direct: 
		- An agent requires host-to-host contact, for example: 
			- Respiratory droplets 
			- Physical contact 
	- ### Indirect: 
		- An agent can travel through other intermediate sources, like: 
			- Waterborne (cholera)
			- Foodborne (salmonella, norovirus, etc.)
			- Vectorborne (malaria, etc.)
				- Animals; mosquitos, flies, etc. 
			- Vehicle-borne (via fomites)
				- Inanimate objects; door handles, unsterilized medical equipment, etc. 
### Chain of Infection: 
- The chain of infection (CoI) can be thought of as four sequential links, with overlaps between adjacent links, such that: 
	1) Agent: 
		- The disease producing factor
	2) Source/Reservoir: 
		- The Environment/habitat in which an agent can live and multiply 
			- In the overlap between the reservoir link and the mode of transmission, there exists the portal of exist, which is how the agent exits the reservoir
	3) Mode of Transmission: 
		- How an agent moves from reservoir to a susceptible host (direct or indirect)
			- Includes the portal of entry
	4) Host: 
		- The individual at risk of disease
## Disease Patterns: 
- There are four main categories that typically describe how diseases behave, including: 
	1) Endemics: 
		- Illness is consistently present in an area 
	2) Epidemics/Outbreaks:
		- Cases of illness are higher than expected AND are caused by a common exposure 
		- Epidemics are over a larger area & outbreaks are over smaller areas
		- Some severe illnesses or previously eradicated diseases are defined as outbreaks 
	3) Pandemics: 
		- Worldwide epidemics (eg. H1N1, SARS, Covid-19, etc.)
## Herd Immunity: 
- Herd immunity is the *indirect protection from an infectious agent that occurs when enough of the population is immune through either vaccination or previous infection*
	- Herd immunity is sometimes called 'population immunity'
- Herd immunity helps make it more difficult for a disease to spread 
# Morbidity Measures: Counts, Incidence, & Prevalence: 
## Morbidity: 
- Morbidity is the measure of the states of disease and includes both prevalence and incidence
## Counts: 
- Counts are the simplest and most frequently performed quantitative measure in epidemiology 
- Counts are defined as the number of cases of a specific disease or health phenomena 
## Prevalence: 
- Prevalence is defined to be the number of **total cases** of a *certain health outcome in a population over a specific time period*, and **indicates the burden of disease** (the extent/magnitude of the outcome), such that: $$\text{Prevalence} = \frac{\text{ \# Total Cases}}{\text{Total Population}} \tag{Prevalence Def}$$
- Once an individual is an existing case, they remain one unless they: 
	1) Recover
		- Individuals with chronic diseases may not ever recover (HIV, type 1 diabetes, etc.)
	2) Die
- Due to the temporal nature of prevalence, there are three main types of prevalence including: 
	- ### Point Prevalence: 
		- Prevalence of a health outcome at one point in time (eg. September 1st, 2024)
	- ### Period Prevalence: 
		- Prevalence of a health outcome over a period of time (eg. 2020-2024)
	- ### Cumulative Lifetime Prevalence: 
		- Prevalence of a health outcome over a lifetime, for example, the prevalence of people **ever** diagnosed with disease $X$ 
## Incidence: 
- Incidence is defined as the number of **new cases** of a *certain health outcome in an at-risk population over a specific time period*, and indicates the risk of disease (the probability that an at-risk individual with experience a certain health outcome), such that: $$\text{Incidence} = \frac{\text{\# of New Cases}}{\text{Total Population \textit{at risk}}} \tag{Incidence Def}$$
# Mortality: 
## Crude Mortality: 
- Crude mortality is defined as the number of total deaths in a population over a specified time period and is often expressed as the number of deaths per unit size of a population, such that: $$\text{Crude Mortality} = \frac{\text{\# of Total Deaths}}{\text{Total Population}} \tag{Crude Mortality Def}$$
	- Crude mortality is adjacent to prevalence of a health outcome, except it measures total deaths
### Adjusted Mortality & Limitations of Crude Mortality: 
- Crude mortality does not account for systematic factors that impact mortality, such as age. 
- To address these limitations and to enable us to compare mortality across different populations, there are statistic procedures to remove the effect of different population compositions, including: 
	1) Age-adjusted mortality 
	2) Sex-adjusted mortality 
# Surveillance: 
## Definition & Motivation:
- Surveillance is defined as the methods of collecting of health-related and health-adjacent data, which helps: 
	1) Assess health status at a population level
	2) Define objectives, priorities, and strategies, and thus, effectively target interventions
	3) Evaluate the effectiveness of interactions and control efforts
	4) Generate research hypotheses
	5) Monitor trends over time 
	6) Detect outbreaks 
- Thus, surveillance informs control and prevention of diseases, which can be visualized such that: $$\begin{matrix}
\text{Monitoring Disease} & \to & \text{Idenitfy Risk Factors} \\
\uparrow &  & \downarrow \\
\text{Evaluate Effectiveness}& \leftarrow& \text{Intervene}
\end{matrix}$$
## Steps in Conducting Surveillance: 
- The steps in conducting surveillance include: 
	1) Identifying, defining, and measuring a health problem of interest and the objective of a surveillance program 
	2) Collecting and compiling data about the problem of interest
	3) Analyzing and interpreting the collected data
	4) Sharing data with stakeholders to start change
	5) Monitoring and evaluating the usefulness of surveillance programs
## Criterion for Selecting Health Problems: 
- Not all health problems are interest necessarily benefit from surveillance and even then, the expense and invasion of privacy may not be the most effective initial step in creating an intervention plan, thus we consider: 
	1) How important is the problem of interest to Public Health?
		- We can use quantitative measures like: 
			- Incidence/Prevalence
			- Severity & Consequence/Mortality 
			- Socioeconomic Impact 
			- Communicability/Virality 
			- Public Perception 
			- International Requirements 
			- ...
	2) How capable are stakeholders/administrations in the prevention, control, and potential treatment of the problem?
	3) What is the capacity of the health system to enable and implement these control measures? This depends on factors, such as: 
		- Response speed 
		- Economics & Availability of Resources (including data)
		- Ability to ensure that individuals receive the treatment they need
## Common Attributes of Surveillance Systems: 
1) Simple & Stable 
2) Acceptable (in terms of data collection)
3) Standardized & uniform, high-quality data
4) Timely (in the reporting of events/cases)
5) Representative of the entire population (not biased)
6) Sensitive (to changes in trends & outbreaks)
7) Flexible in terms of incorporating changing needs 
## Active vs Passive Surveillance: 
### Active: 
- Health departments may **contact** healthcare providers and/or laboratories about conditions to identify cases
- Active surveillance is useful when there is a **need to identify all cases**, but *typically is more expensive than passive* surveillance
### Passive: 
- Health departments **rely** on healthcare providers and/or laboratories to report cases of disease
- Passive surveillance is efficient for how expensive it is, but is often incomplete due to underreporting 
## Data Analysis of Surveillance Data: 
- We **analyze** of *person, place, and time*, and then **interpret** *changes in quantitative measures*, like prevalence and/or incidence over time 
- We then **disseminate** data and interpretations to *healthcare providers, public health professionals, and the community* at large. 
- Then, we **evaluate** & **improve** upon the surveillance system to reduce costs and increase effective reporting 
# Study Design: 
- We begin with a diagram to better understand the structure of study design, such that: $$\begin{matrix}
& & \text{Observational} & & &  | & \text{Experimental}\\
& \swarrow & & \searrow& & | & \downarrow \\
&\text{Descriptive} & & \text{Analytical}& &  |& \text{RCTs} \\
\swarrow& \downarrow & & \downarrow & \searrow & |\\
\text{Cross-Sectional} & \text{Ecological} & & \text{Case-Control}& \text{Cohort}& | &  
\end{matrix}$$
## Observational Studies: 
- Observational studies examine individuals in a "non-controlled" fashion, meaning, the **researcher does not assign exposures and observes** *how they occur naturally*.
- This implies that the investigator: 
	1) Documents who is exposed or non-exposed 
	2) Documents who has or has not developed the outcome of interest 
### Descriptive Study Designs: 
- Meant to **generate hypothesis** and includes cross-sectional & ecological study-designs
#### Ecological Studies: 
-  The units of analysis are "groups/aggregates", such as: 
	1) Countries, provinces, states, countries, regions, neighborhoods, etc. 
	2) Organizations, like hospitals, school districts, and schools
- Ecological studies often use group-level data to determine trends or associations of health outcomes in a population and measure both exposure and outcome for each group/aggregate, typically at the same time. 
	- Often used when individual-level data is not available and/or not relevant and is typically bolstered by secondary data
	- Many are cross-sectional 
- The advantages of ecological studies include: 
	1) Quick, simple, & inexpensive to conduct
	2) Effective for generating hypotheses 
	3) Some exposures may be invariant within a given group, which means individual-level data may not be required or as significant
	4) Some questions may be about group differences
	5) Contextual clues from group-level data may help correct biases and confounding
- Furthermore, the disadvantages include: 
	1) Inherently is an imprecise measurement of exposure and disease
	2) Observations made at a group-level may not represent the exposure-disease relationship at the individual-level
	3) **Ecological Fallacy** can occur, meaning that incorrect inferences about individuals are made from group-level data
#### Cross-Sectional Studies: 
- The units of analysis are individuals as Individual-level exposure and disease information is collected at the same "slice" in time, as there is one period of observation. 
	- Many cross-sectional studies are surveys 
	- Otherwise called "**prevalence study**"
- Cross-sectional studies are useful in estimating the magnitude and distribution of a health problem, as they examine trends in disease or risk factors/exposures that can vary over time. 
	- This enables more effective planning of health services, the administration of medical care, and other intervention planning methodologies. 
	- Helps generate hypotheses 
- Cross-sectional studies are best suited for studying non-fatal, chronic health conditions. 
- The analysis of cross-sectional studies includes the calculation of a measure called "prevalence ratio", which is calculated by comparing the prevalence of disease across an exposed and un-exposed group. An example includes: $$\begin{matrix}
& \text{Outcome +} & \text{Outcome } - & \\
\text{Exposure +} &a &b & \\
\text{Exposure} - &c &d &
\end{matrix}\tag{Prevalence Table}$$
	- We can then calculate the prevalence in the exposed, un-exposed groups, and the overall prevalence ratio of a health outcome, such that: $$\begin{align}
&\frac{a}{a+b} \tag{Exposed Prevalence} \\ \\
&\frac{c}{c+d} \tag{Un-Exposed Prevalence} \\ \\
\frac{\text{EP}}{\text{U-EP}}&= \frac{a(c+d)}{c(a+b)} \tag{Prevalence Ratio}
\end{align}$$
	- The interpretation of prevalence ratio follows: 
		- The prevalence of "health outcome" amongst those with "exposure" is "prevalence ratio" of "health outcome" compared to those without "exposure". 
- The advantages of cross-sectional studies include: 
	1) Inexpensive & easy to conduct
	2) Describes the magnitude and distribution of health problems
	3) Identifies trends of disease or risk factors/exposures
	4) Examines multiple associations at once
	5) Useful for hypothesis generation and intervention planning
- The disadvantages include: 
	1) Does not establish temporality:
		- Does not imply that the exposure leads to an outcome. Only implies that exposed groups are more likely to experience a certain outcome. 
	2) Identifies prevalent cases, not incident cases 
	3) Victim to non-response bias: 
		- Individuals who respond to questionnaires are systematically different than those who do not 
	4) Considered the weakest observational design
#### Cohort Studies: 
- The units of observation are at the individual-level, despite the "group" nature. 
- Cohort studies are the study of two or more groups of people at risk of an outcome who differ according to exposure. The "groups" are defined by an individuals exposure status and are followed over time to determine the incidence of an outcome. 
	- Also known as prospective studies, incidence studies, follow-up studies, longitudinal studies, and panel studies. 
	- Involves the collection of primary data, although secondary sources are sometimes used for both exposure and disease assessment 
	- Considered to the best observational study-design
- To do a cohort-study we must assemble the cohorts methodologically, which can be done in two primary ways: 
	1) Population-based Cohorts: 
		- Includes either the entire population or a representative sample of the population 
		- Exposures are unknown until the first observation 
	2) Exposure-based Cohorts: 
		- Find individuals with a common exposure and then, similarly, identify groups of individuals without exposure who are similar to the exposed individuals. 
		- Implies that exposure-based cohorts are good for rare exposures 

- Due to the nature of cohort studies, we can calculate the risk/incidence and incidence rates of a health outcome. 
### Analytic Study Designs: 
- Meant to **test hypotheses** and includes cohort design, case-control, mixed-method, and RCT study-designs
## Experimental Study Designs: 
- Studies in which the researcher assigns exposure to people, for example: 
	- Intervention programs (lifestyle programs for diabetics, smoking cessation, etc.)
	- Treatment methods (experimental drugs, the combination of existing drugs, etc.)
### Randomized Controlled Trials:
#### Units of Analysis: 
- The units of analysis is at the individual level 
	- One group of individuals receives an intervention and another group does not 
		- Do women with stage 1 breat cancer given a lumpectomy alone survive as long without recurrence of disease as women who are given a lumpectomy plus radiation?
- Community trials are where the unit of analysis is the group or community 
	- An experimental study where one community receives an intervention and another community does not 
		- Does fluoride in the water supply decrease the frequency of dental cavities in a community compared to a similar community without such water treatment?
#### RCT Definition:
- An RCT is a planned experiment amongst human subjects where investigators assign study participants to either an intervention or control group 
- Trials are designed to test the efficacy of an intervention OR a clinical treatment 
	- Preventative vs Therapeutic Trials:
		- Preventive trials include a prophylactic agent given to healthy or high-risk individuals to prevent the onset of a certain health outcome
	- Therapeutic: 
		- Therapeutic trials include a treatment or therapy given to individuals with a certain outcome to:
			1) Reduce the risk of recurrence
			2) Improve survival odds
			3) Increase quality of life 
- RCTs are often considered the "gold standard" because they have high validity 
#### Key Features: 
- RCTs have AT LEAST one intervention group AND one control group 
	- The control group ideally has the **same baseline risk and are observed in the same capacity** as the treatment group. Individuals in the control group may receive: 
		1) No intervention
		2) A placebo 
		3) An alternative treatment than the intervention group. This can include the current standard of care for the specific health outcome 
- Participants are **randomized** to the greatest extent possible 
	- Ideally, all participants would have an equal change of being in either the intervention OR control groups 
- **Blinding/Masking** occurs wherever possible, and to the greatest extent possible. The levels of blinding follow such that: 
	1) Single-Blind: 
		- Participants are blinded to their own group assignment, but investigators and analysts are aware of each individual's assignment 
			- This protects against the placebo effect, so that individuals don't show improvement due to believing they're receiving the intervention 
	2) Double-Blind: 
		- Neither participants nor investigators are aware of participant group assignment, but analysts are not. 
			- This protects the researchers treating individuals in different groups differently 
	3) Triple-Blind:
		- Treatment and research approaches are not obvious to participants or to investigators; analyses are also completed in a manner that blinds analysts from participant group assignment 
#### Conducting an RCT:
- To conduct an RCT, researchers follow the following steps: 
	1) Intervention Selection/Proposal Development:
		- Researchers develop the RCT's objective and must establish whether the intervention being tested is safe, active against the mechanism of disease, superior to other interventions, and feasible in terms of implementation. 
	2) IRB Approval/Ethics Review:
	3) Cohort Assembly/Participant Enrollment: 
		- Inclusion Criterion: Who do we aim to **retain** in the study? 
			- Which population is **best for generalizing study findings**?
			- Which population is **most efficient for answering the proposed research question**?
		- Exclusion Criterion: Who do we aim to **exclude** of the study?
			- Which populations will **inhibit the ability to control errors**?
			- Which populations will have **difficulty being compliant with the intervention methods**?
	4) Baseline Variable Measurement: What are the initial characteristics of the study cohort?
		- Demographics of included participants 
		- Clinical Factors of Relevance 
	5) Comparison Group Selection: 
		- Sometimes, certain health outcomes may improve without treatment, which is attributed to the following:  
			- Placebo Effect $\implies$ Patients improve because of a non-intervention
			- Hawthorne Effect $\implies$ Patients improve because of observation
	6) Monitoring for Outcomes:
		- Outcomes are treated as dependent variables 
		- Investigators may sometimes choose intermediate outcomes as the "best" outcome may be difficult to determine 
	7) Ensuring Compliance: 
		- Researchers must monitor each patient's adherence to the intervention protocol, which can include: 
			- Self-reporting 
			- Direct evaluation by research staff
			- Pill counts
			- Urine/Blood metabolite levels
		- Behavioral interventions should be well tolerated, and so, researchers may monitor participants attendance and engagement of patients
#### Analysis of RCT Results: 
- Researchers must: 
	1) Report appropriate overall risk and rates 
	2) Present comparisons of risk/rates of outcomes between the intervention and control groups 
	3) Present measures of quality-of-life interventions and any changes in the severity of symptoms 
#### Ethical Considerations of RCTs:
1) Clinical Equipoise: 
	- Researchers must balance doubt about the efficacy of an intervention with the belief that it may produce positive results 
2) Stopping Rules: 
	- If a new intervention is discovered to be beneficial or toxic, the ongoing trials must stop to protect the patients
	- Data Safety and Monitoring Boards must monitor the trial data to determine beneficence or toxicity of an intervention
#### Advantages & Disadvantages of RCTs: 
- Advantages include: 
	1) Investigators control the amount, timing, and frequency of an intervention 
	2) RCTs are able to demonstrate causal relationships between interventions and changes in outcomes 
	3) Randomization and blinding ensure validity 
	4) RCTs are sometimes the only practical approach to understanding the causal relationship between certain interventions and changes in outcomes 
- Disadvantages include: 
	1) RCTs cannot be used to study potentially harmful interventions
	2) Interventions may not be suitable to blinding or may be significantly different from real-world application 
	3) RCTs have limited generalizability due to their controlled nature 
	4) Loss to follow-up can cause missing data for outcomes 
	5) RCTs are both expensive and hard to recruit individuals into either the intervention and control groups 
#### Types of RCTs: 
1) Non-Inferiority (Equivalency):
	- New interventions are as effective as the current standard of care for a specific health outcome 
	- Null hypothesis is that treatments are different in terms of effectiveness
2) Superiority: 
	- The new intervention is better than the current standard of care 
	- Null hypothesis is that the new treatment is better than the current standard of care
# Screening: 
## Levels of Prevention:
- We begin with identifying the levels of prevention that researchers target to help curb the onset of a specific health outcome: 
	1) Primary: 
		- Prevent disease (eg. immunization, seat belts, malaria chemoprophylaxis, etc.)
	2) Secondary: 
		- Identify and intervene at the subclinical stage, before a patient starts presenting and suffering from symptoms (eg. mammography, colonoscopies, Ha1c tests, x-rays, etc.)
	3) Tertiary: 
		- Identify and intervene at the clinical stage, where patient has already started presenting and suffering from symptoms (eg. controlling blood sugar, blood thinners to prevent heart attacks, etc.)
## Screening Defintion: 
- Screening is the identification of a disease in asymptomatic individuals or those at the subclinical stage 
	- Is a secondary level of prevention
## Types of Screening:
1) Mass screening: 
	- Screening on a large scale of an entire population, regardless of risk status 
2) Selective Screening: 
	- Screens subsets of the population that is at high risk for a specific health outcome 
## Properties of Good Screening Tests: 
1) Simplicity:
	- Easy to learn and perform for volunteers
2) Rapid/Quick turnaround: 
	- Quick to administer 
	- Results are quickly available
3) Inexpensive: 
	- Good cost-to-benefit ratio
4) Safe:
	- No harm is done to individuals
## Reliability & Validity: 
1) Reliability is the consistency of the screening test
	- If one individual is tested multiple times they should return the same result most of the time 
	- Internal Consistency is the consistency of results across many different individuals 
	- Inter-rater Reliability is the consistency of results across trained experts
2) Validity is the accuracy of the screening test
	- How often does the screening test positive when an individual actually has the disease?
	- Measures the ability of a test or scale to give a true measure 
	- Content Validity: 
		- The effectiveness of which mechanism being tested is in screening for a health outcome
	- Construct Validity: 
		- The degree to which the measurement agrees with theoretical results 
## Screening Test Results vs True Disease Status: 
- Screenings are often done across entire populations
	- If a screener returns a positive, the individual will undergo more rigorous diagnostic testing to confirm their disease status 
- The objective of screening is to lower morbidity and mortality 
## $2 \times 2$ Table, Sensitivity & Specificity: 
$$\begin{bmatrix}
& \text{Disease +} & \text{Disease -} & \\
\text{Screen +}& \text{TP}& \text{FP}&  \\
\text{Screen -}& \text{FN}& \text{TN}&  \\
\end{bmatrix}$$
- TP:= Patients who screen positive and have the disease 
- TN:= Patients who screen negative and do not have the disease
- FP:= People who screen positive but do not have the disease
- FN:= People who screen negative and do not have the disease 
- Sensitivity is the ability of a screener to correctly identify individuals who truly have the disease 
	- Want to maximize true positives and minimize false positives $$\frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP + FN}} \tag{Sensitivity}$$

- Specificity is the ability of a test to correctly identify someone who truly do not have the disease 
	- Want to maximize true negative and minimize false negatives $$\frac{\text{TN}}{\text{FN + FP}} \tag{Specificity}$$
## Cutoff Points: 
- Sensitivity and specificity of tests are dependent on the cutoff point of a screening test
	- Cutoff points determine when someone goes from testing negative to testing positive on a screening test 
- High Cutoff Points: 
	- Will capture less true cases and more false negatives
	- Fewer people will incorrectly test positive when they truly do not have the disease
- Low Cutoff Points: 
	- Will produce less false negatives but more false positives 
	- More people will incorrectly test positive when they do not truly have the disease
### Determining Cutoff Points: 
- The goal is to balance the number of false positives against the number of false positives 
	- If a diagnostic test is expensive and/or invasive, the cutoff point should prioritize specificity to minimize false positives
	- If the penalty for missing a true positive is high, the cutoff point should prioritize sensitivity to minimize false positives 
## Biases: 
### Lead Time Bias: 
- The amount of time saved between the screening for a disease and the diagnosis of a disease 
	- Survival time from diagnosis to death, or another outcome, is longer because the patient was diagnosed earlier, not because their survival was truly better 
### Length Time Bias: 
- When less aggressive forms of a disease are more likely to be detected because they have longer preclinical detection windows compared to more aggressive forms of the same disease
- Less aggressive forms are more likely to be cause via screening and thus improve survival outcomes 
### Compliance/Volunteer Bias: 
- People who choose to be screened are more conscious of their health than those who are not screened
	- Is a type of selection bias
# Bias: 
## Bias Definition: 
- Bias is any systematic error in a study that results in an incorrect estimate of the association between an exposure and a specific health outcome 
	- Bias occurs when the estimated associated deviates from the true measure of association 
## Random Error vs Systematic Error: 
- Random error includes processes that cause unpredictable errors in results 
	- Random error is expected but can be minimized with larger sample sizes
- Systematic error is bias and is a consequence of issues with study design, data collection, and/or analysis 
	- Systematic error can be minimized by thoroughly planning the study from design to data analysis 
## Types & Effects of Bias: 
- Bias in all forms threaten the internal validity of the results and can cause an over/under estimate of the true association between an exposure and a health outcome
- Includes: 
	- Information bias
	- Selection bias
### Information Bias: 
- Results in the incorrect classification of participants as either, exposed/unexposed and diseased/not diseased
	- Occurs when obtaining information regarding individuals in a study 
		- Occurs after participants have entered a study while collecting data from participants 
		- Alternatively referred to as "measurement bias" or "misclassification"
- In terms of the 2x2 table, information bias results in the incorrect number in an entry of the table 
#### Recall bias: 
- Mainly occurs in case-control bias 
	- Cases are more likely to remember/recognize exposure status as it relates cause of their disease status
		- Caused by a difference in the recalled exposure status and the fabrication of information
	- Affects the calculated odds-ratio vs the true odds-ratio
#### Social desirability bias: 
- Occurs when people choose to answer questions in a way that portray themselves in a better light 
	- Especially important when considering stigmatized behaviors, like smoking or HIV status 
	- Affects the calculated risk-ratio vs the true risk-ratio
#### Interview bias: 
- Occurs when there is a systematic difference in the way that data is gathered, recorded, or interpreted from phone and/or in-person interviews
- Affects the calculated risk-ratio vs the true risk-ratio
### Preventing Information Bias: 
- To prevent information bias from affecting the results of a study, researchers aim to use: 
	1) Precise definitions of exposure and outcome
	2) Objective measures rather than subjective measures (eg. clinical tests vs self-reporting)
	3) Verification of information from multiple sources (eg. self-reporting AND medical records)
	4) Blinding of participants exposure and/or disease status 
	5) Detailed measurement protocols 
	6) Training, certification, and re-certification of study staff 
	7) Standardizing questions with close-ended questions
### Selection Bias: 
- Occurs when recruiting and/or keeping participants involved in a study 
- Includes the subtypes: 
#### Self-selection bias: 
- Occurs when individuals that choose to participate are systematically different from the larger population
- Affects the calculated prevalence ratio vs the true prevalence ratio
#### Control group selection: 
- Occurs with case-control studies specifically 
	- Since we want the control to be representative of the distribution of exposures in the larger source population
- Affects the calculated odds-ratio vs true odds-ratio
#### Loss to follow-up: 
- Occurs when participants retention in a study is related to their exposure and/or outcome status 
- Important for study designs that follow individuals over time, like prospective cohort studies and RCTs
- Affects the calculated risk-ratio vs true risk-ratio
#### Healthy Worker effect
- Occurs when there is a problem with studies of occupational exposures that use general population as a comparison group
	- Workers tend to be healthier than the general population, due to a variety of factors like disability, disease status, etc.
- Affects risk-ratio
### Preventing Selection Bias: 
- To prevent selection bias, researchers can:
	- Aim to make individuals in the comparison groups as similar as possible, such that they're exchangeable 
	- Encourage participation and retention through incentives
		- Should aim for ~80% or more 
	- Ensure controls are good comparisons for cases by selecting from the same source population 
		- If a control became a case, would they still be included in the study?
# Confounding:
## Confounding Definition: 
- Confounding occurs when an observed association between an exposure and an outcome exists because of the influence of a confounding variable 
	- The confounder affects the exisiting association between an exposure and an outcome
	- Occurs in all studies 
- A variable can be considered to be a confounder if: 
	1) It is a risk factor for the outcome 
		- The risk of disease is different for those with the confounder than those who don't
	2) It is associated with the exposure 
		- The exposed vs unexposed groups have different distribution of the confounder(s)
	3) It is not on the causal pathway between the exposure and the outcome 
		- Exposure does not cause the confounder
## Levels of Confounding: 
### Full Confounding: 
- Occurs when the confounder is completely responsible for creating the association between exposure and outcome when there is no true association 
	- If you account for the confounder, there is no association at all (eg. RR=2.5 w/ confounder and RR=1 w/o confounder)
### Partial Confounding: 
- Occurs when the confounder is partially responsible for changing the association between exposure and outcome
	- If you account for the confounder, there is still an association between the exposure and outcome but to a different extent
## Accounting for Confounders: 
- To account for confounders, there are two stages at which they can be addressed, including: 
### Study Design Stage: 
#### Restriction:
- Exclude individuals that have been exposed to the confounding exposure 
	- Advantages include: 
		- Convenient/Straight forward
		- Inexpensive
	- Disadvantages include: 
		- Effects of the restriction factor itself cannot be examined 
		- Reduces the sample size 
		- Reduces the generalizability of results
#### Randomization (specifically in RCTs):
- Randomize the exposure (NOT the confounder)
- Randomization balances all known and unknown confounders
	- Advantages include: 
		- With sufficient sample size, you are assured that the known and unknown confounders are controlled for 
	- Disadvantages include: 
		- Not always possible to control exposure and assign participants due to ethical guidelines
		- Requires relatively large samples 
#### Matching:
- Often used in case-control studies
- For every case with the confounding exposure, there should be a corresponding individual in the control group with the confounding exposure
	- Advantages include: 
		- Better analytic efficiency 
	- Disadvantages include: 
		- Cannot examine the relationship between the confounder and the outcome
		- Impossible to match on all confounders
### Data Analysis Stage: 
#### Stratification: 
- To identify a confounder analytically, we can compare the crude and stratified measures of association, such that: 
	1) Calculate the crude measure of association 
	2) Calculate strata specific measures of association 
	3) Compare the crude and strata measures and if they're different within a certain margin, the exposure is a confounder
- Advantages include: 
	- Statistically appealing/acceptable in the field 
	- Enhances the understanding of data, as analysts can extract key information that is lost through aggregation
- Disadvantages include: 
	- Unable to simultaneously control multiple confounders
#### Statistical Adjustment 
- Statistically control for the confounder 
- Not covered in undergraduate epidemiology 
# Ethics & Causality: 
## Nuremberg Code: 
- Authored in response to the many Nazi war crimes, including human experimentation, and protects individuals who cannot consent
- The code follows such that: 
	1) Voluntary human consent is essential 
	2) Experimental results should result in good for society 
	3) Anticipated results should justify the experiment 
	4) Avoids all unnecessary physical and mental suffering of participants
	5) No trials/studies are conducted if there is chance of harm
	6) Studies should minimize the risk of patients
	7) Proper preparations and facilities should exist to protect patients
	8) Experiments can only be conducted by qualified persons
	9) Subjects can withdraw at any time 
	10) Studies/trials should be terminated if the results are known
## Declaration of Helsinki:
- Drafted in 1964 in response to placebo trials in developing countries and focuses specifically more on clinical research 
- The use of placebo is justified whenever its use does not cause irreversible damage or considerable suffering to a well-informed patient 
## Belmont Report: 
- Written in 1976 in response to the Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment
- Is an ideological and theoretical foundation of ethical research guidelines amongst US academic institutions that are receiving federal funding for research
- The three main principles of these guidelines include:
	1) Beneficence:
		- Do no harm and secure a patient's well-being
		- Minimize the potential harms and maximize the potential benefits
		- Careful and thorough assessment of risks and benefits 
			- Risks include physical, psychological, legal, social, and economic harms 
	2) Justice: 
		- Equitable distribution of research costs and benefits 
		- Injustice occurs when a benefit to which someone is entitled to is denied without good reason or when some burden is imposed unreasonably/unfairly. 
		- Requires the careful selection of subjects that considers both the individual and collective benefit and cost
	3) Respect of persons: 
		- Individuals should be treated as autonomous agents
		- Persons with diminished autonomy are entitled to protection 
			- May be inherent (eg. limited capacity to process and understand information)
			- May be situational (eg. prisoners, children, and pregnant women and their fetus)
		- Requires informed consent
## Institutional Review Boards: 
- Independent evaluators that review protocols for studies involve human subjects to ensure they are conducted ethically 
- Requires the consideration of: 
	1) Informed consent: 
		- Process of education and decision-making that begins with initial contact and is maintained throughout the duration of the study 
		- An understanding of the study so individuals can make a truly informed, autonomous decision about whether to participate 
		- Ongoing process that requires including changes in risk factors that may affect an individual's choice to continue participating
	2) Privacy and confidentiality: 
		- Privacy requires the control over the extent, timing, and circumstances of sharing the individual's facilities with others
		- Confidentiality requires:
			- The treatment of information that an individual discloses with trust 
			- The expectation that information will not be shared without permission, beyond the already disclosed and agreed upon amount
	3) Disclosure of risks and benefits 
	4) Disclosure of conflict of interest 
## Bradford Hill Criterion: 
1) Strength of association
2) Consistency 
3) Specificity 
4) Temporality 
5) Biological Gradient
6) Plausibility 
7) Coherence
8) Experiment
9) Analogy
