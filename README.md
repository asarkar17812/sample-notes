This repo contains a few of my notes that I've taken over the course of my undergraduate degree. Many of them are a WIP as I continue to learn and so I've only included a couple here. I aim to revisit many of my notes and update them eventually so that they may be useful to others, but for now, I am focused on learning and practicing mathematics and its adjacent subjects to make the most of this opportunity. At the very least, I hope what I have uploaded can be of use to someone, regardless of the lack of polish.

Cheers!
